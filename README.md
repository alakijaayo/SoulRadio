## Build Status

## Description
Based on my final project at Makers Academy. SoulRadio is a music media application and website that allows users to listen, share, sync and discuss music in a collaborative space. The application aims to allow users to join a room together and enjoy a space where they can listen to mucis at the same time regardless of where they are, as well as be able to share new music with new users and discuss music within the group. Other features I aim to provide are:

- Add songs to the current playlist
- Vote on the songs available in the playlist giving them an upvote if they like it or down vote it if the don't
- Listen to music simultaneously
- View how many people are in the room
- Skip the song if there are too many down votes

The aim of this project is for me to rebuild the application that we built using different technologies. I will still use ReactJS on the frontend, but will be using Java on the backend to not only act as the server but to run the frontend at the same time, to give the application a full-stack feel unlike we did last time. This will allow me to have a better understanding of how to build projects in a full-stack way and gain new understanding of Java.
